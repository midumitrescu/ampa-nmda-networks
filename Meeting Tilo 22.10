Master Project - what can we focus on/

Mean field Theory for AMPA - GABA with conductance based.

-> Mean Field Eq  + Analysis, Limit
k-> inf => drive of the neuron is a population activity.
Alternatively, FP equation of the mean field

They use effective time constant approximation.

Sanzeni: population of unconnected neurons. There is no coupling.

Vogels & Abbot: Detailed Balance theory: Gating multiple
Signal Propagation and Logic Gating


In the notes: think of lumping together E and I


General Title: Analysis of Computational Model in Conductance Networks with NMDA Input

Network Dynamics with NMDA synaptic conductances
Question
-> what is the effect of NMDA in network dynamics / stability / bifurcation
        -> Find titles that are more specific


-> could make the prediction on the overall current ratio A+G / Nmda

-> mean field theory
-> would be good to have a bit more analytical framework
-> check if some limits make sense
